# Build an EarthShineGen gridpack.
#
# Follows the same shape as blackmax_gridpack.sh: pick a CMSSW release, stage
# the generator into a work directory, drop in a runcmsgrid.sh and tar the lot
# up with xz.  EarthShineGen is pure Python on top of numpy and scipy, both of
# which every recent CMSSW release ships, so there is nothing to compile.
#
# Usage
#   ./earthshinegen_gridpack.sh run3
#       generic gridpack: the mass point is passed at run time, as
#       ExternalLHEProducer arguments
#
#   ./earthshinegen_gridpack.sh run3 <m_X> <m_A> <epsilon> <alpha_X> <dm_model>
#       specific gridpack: the parameters are baked into parameter.txt and the
#       runcmsgrid script takes only nevents/seed/ncpu
#
# Examples
#   ./earthshinegen_gridpack.sh run3
#   ./earthshinegen_gridpack.sh run3 7000 0.23 1e-8 max core
