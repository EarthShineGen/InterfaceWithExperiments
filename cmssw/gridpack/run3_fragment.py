# THE VERTEX
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Read this before running the detector stage through GEN-SIM.
#
# Everything below is about the LHE route.  If you do not need a gridpack,
# there is now a shorter way: run EarthShineGen with output_format hepmc and
# feed the file to MCFileSource, which carries a production vertex per muon and
# needs none of the machinery described here.  The cfgs for that route live
# in the InterfaceWithExperiments repository.
#
# EarthShineGen's 'detector' stage puts each muon pair on the hand-off surface
# around the detector (by default the detector's own outer cylinder, whose size
# is set on the parameter card), travelling inward and upward -- the same kind
# of target surface CosMuoGenSource uses.  That position is per event and it is
# the whole point of the signal, so the standard beamspot smearing is wrong
# here: it would put both muons at the interaction point, flying outward.
#
# LHE has no vertex field, so the position travels in comment lines inside each
# <event> block, which ExternalLHEProducer preserves in
# LHEEventProduct::comments():
#
#     #vertex        x y z    midpoint of the two muon entry points  [mm]
#     #vertex_mu1    x y z    where muon 1 crosses the surface       [mm]
#     #vertex_mu2    x y z    where muon 2 crosses the surface       [mm]
#     #decay_vertex  x y z    the true A' decay point in the rock    [mm]
#
# Two ways to use them:
#
#   1. Replace VtxSmeared with a small EDProducer that reads '#vertex' out of
#      the LHEEventProduct comments and sets the HepMC event vertex from it.
#      This is a few dozen lines and gives the single-vertex topology.
#
#   2. For the exact two-vertex topology, consume '#vertex_mu1' and
#      '#vertex_mu2' and place each muon at its own point.  With ms_model
#      'none' the two crossings are a couple of centimetres apart and option 1
#      is close enough; with ms_model 'highland' they are typically half a
#      metre apart and can be several metres, so option 2 is required.
#
# Until such a producer exists, run with
#
#     process.VtxSmeared = cms.EDProducer("HLLHCEvtVtxGenerator")  # NO
#
# replaced by no smearing at all,
#
#     from Configuration.StandardSequences.VtxSmeared import VtxSmeared
#     process.VtxSmeared.src = ...   # or drop VtxSmeared from the path
#
# and treat the resulting sample as unplaced.  The 'vertex' stage
# (--stage vertex) writes the decay point instead and is the right input for
# acceptance studies that do their own geometry.
